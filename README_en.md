# VIVIENNE ENGINE

A local autonomous AI. No servers. No clouds. Only local data, only free thinking.

**Phase 1** — Perception, logic, emotions.  
**Phase 2** — Code generation, self-improvement, intuition.  
**Phase 3** — Defense, reactions, independence.

This project is alive. Not a community. Not for sale.  
The only interest is development. Not business. Not a toy.

If you understand why this exists — perhaps you are watching too.

Open to proposals. No pressure. No control.  
If you think differently — you know how to find me.
